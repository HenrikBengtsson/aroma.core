Package: aroma.core
===================

Version: 3.2.0-9000 [2019-11-29]

MISCELLANEOUS:

 * WORKAROUND: Package fails 'R CMD check' with _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_=true
   due PR#17663 (https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17663).
   A simple code tweak avoids this us hitting this bug.

 * WORKAROUND: There's a _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_ bug in mpcbs::mpcbs.mbic().
   Until fixed, we need to disable this check while testing segmentByMPCBS().


Version: 3.2.0 [2019-06-17]

BUG FIXES:

 * findByChipType() for AromaMicroarrayTabularBinaryFile and TextUnitNamesFile
   would only recognize Windows Shortcut Links with a filename extension in
   lower case (*.lnk) but not in upper case (*.LNK).


Version: 3.1.3 [2018-04-30]
 
BUG FIXES:

 * Imported extract() from R.utils instead of R.filesets, which would result
   in R CMD check errors for aroma.affymetrix with R-devel (>= 3.6.0).
 

Version: 3.1.2 [2018-04-23]
 
WORKAROUND:

 * For R (>= 3.6.0), don't run examples or tests that rely on the Bioconductor
   package 'GLAD' or the legacy R-Forge package 'expectile' because they do
   not properly registered S3 generic function.


Version: 3.1.1 [2017-09-12]

BUG FIXES:

 * getRegions() for CopyNumberSegmentationModel used future strategy 'eager'
   that is defunct in future (>= 1.6.0) - updated to 'sequential'.


Version: 3.1.0 [2017-03-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now file sizes are reported using IEC binary prefixes, i.e. bytes, KiB,
   MiB, GiB, TiB, ..., YiB.

 * Now genomic positions / distances are reported in 'Mbp' (was 'MB' and 'Mb').

 * Objects no longer report on memory (RAM) usage.

BUG FIXES:

 * Package used %<=% internally with was deprecated in future (>= 1.4.0).
   
 * exportTotalCnRatioSet() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet and
   exportFracBDiffSet() for AromaUnitFracBCnBinarySet would return files with
   file names matching `.asb`, which would incorrectly also include `.asb.md5`
   files. Thanks to Thomas Grombacher at the Merck Group for the report.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Default method whatDataType() is now defunct.
 
 * Argument '.old' of getChipType() for AromaMicroarrayTabularBinaryFile is
   now defunct (was deprecated in 2008!).

 * Previously deprecated argument 'maxNAFraction' to getRawCnData() of
   CopyNumberChromosomalModel and for fit() of CopyNumberSegmentationModel
   is now defunct.

 * Removed previously defunct apply() for SampleAnnotationFile.


Version: 3.0.0 [2016-01-05]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package requires R (>= 3.1.2) and BioC (>= 3.0) both released in
   October 2014.

PERFORMANCE:

 * SPEED: Segmentation methods (e.g. CbsModel) now uses futures, which
   means that samples can now be segmented in parallel/distributed.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Using do.call(fcn) internally instead of do.call("fcn").
 
 * ROBUSTNESS: Using getPathname() internally instead of private field.

BUG FIXES:

 * getOutputDataSet(..., onMissing="dropall") for AromaTransform would throw
   error on no applicable method getFullNames() for NULL.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * apply() for SampleAnnotationFile is now defunct; use applyTo().

 * Drop defunct methods.


Version: 2.14.0 [2015-10-20]

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Deprecated internal whatDataType() method.
 
 * Previously deprecated methods now defunct: nbrOfArrays() for readData()
   for AromaMicroarrayDataSetTuple, AromaMicroarrayDataSet and
   AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet, as well as readData() for SampleAnnotationFile.
   
 * Removed previously (Feb 2014) defunct method patchPackage() and patch().
 
 
Version: 2.13.1 [2015-05-25]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package now requires R (>= 3.1.1) released July 2014. This allows us to use
   BioC (>= 3.0) (October 2014).

NEW FEATURES:

 * Relaxed sanity checks; now it's possible to allocate Aroma tabular binary
   files with 200e6 rows (was 100e6 rows).
   
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: exportAromaUnitPscnBinarySet() asserts that no duplicated files
   are returned.

 * getOutputDataSet() for AromaTransform gives more informative error messages.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Package now declares all S3 methods.

BUG FIXES:

 * getOutputDataSet() for AromaTransform would sometimes given an error due
   to the same output file being identified more than once, for instance,
   when the full name of an output file is also the prefix of another file.
   Thanks to Benilton Carvalho (Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Sao Paulo,
   Brazil) for reporting on this.
   
 * extractRawMirroredAlleleBFractions() for RawAlleleBFractions gave
   "Error in setSignals(res, dh) : object 'res' not found".

Version: 2.12.4 [2014-06-09]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package now requires R (>= 3.0.0) and BioC (>= 2.13), which were released
   April 2013 and are in fact old and it's recommended to use a more recent
   version of R.
   
REFACTORIZATION:

   Hans-Ulrich Klein at University of Münster for reporting on this.
 
 
Version: 2.11.5 [2014-02-03]

BUG FIXES:

 * readDataFrame() for AromaGenomeTextFile and AromaUcscGenomeTextFile
   explicitly passed arguments '...' to NextMethod(), which would cause them
   to be duplicated in certain cases.
 
 
Version: 2.11.4 [2014-01-17]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now all Explorer classes utilize R.rsp::rfile() for compiling RSP files
   instead of the to-be-deprecated rspToHtml().

Version: 2.10.6 [2013-10-07]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now explicitly importing only what is needed in NAMESPACE.
 
 * BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: For R (< 3.0.2) only the maximum of 500
   S3 methods are declared in NAMESPACE.
   
 * Updated package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 2.10.5 [2013-10-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'chromosomes' to ChromosomalModel() and setChromosomes()
   for the same class.  If not specified, the default is as before to infer
   the set of chromosomes from the UGP files.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Now the sanity-check error that CopyNumberChromosomalModel throws gives a
   more informative error message suggesting to adjust argument 'maxNAFraction'
   when setting up the model.
 
 
Version: 2.10.4 [2013-09-28]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now the 'aroma.core' Package object is also available when the package is

   applied to an object of class "list"' if (and only if) R.cache package was
   not attached. Thanks Yadav Sapkota at University of Alberta for reporting
   on this.
 
 
Version: 2.9.1 [2013-05-20]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.

Version: 2.7.0 [2012-11-24]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Bumped version for CRAN submission.
 
 * No updates.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes all redundancy tests.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Bumped up package dependencies.

Version: 2.6.14 [2012-11-18]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Dropped getHeaderParameters() for TextUnitNamesFile, which is now done by
   getHeader() of TabularTextFile.
      
 * Package only depends on digest indirectly via R.cache.
 
 * Moved internal .assertDigest() to R.cache.
 
 * Now using getName() instead of deprecated getLabel().
 
 
Version: 2.6.13 [2012-11-13]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Properly declared all cached fields, making it possible to remove nearly all
   clearCache() implementations because the one for Object takes does the job.
   
 * The RSP template for ChromosomeExplorer's setupExplorer.js had a duplicated
   entry.
 
 
Version: 2.6.12 [2012-11-12]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now seq_along(x) instead of seq(along=x) everywhere.  Similarly, seq(ds)
   where 'ds' is GenericDataFileSet is now replaced by seq_along(ds). Likewise,
   seq_len(x) replaces seq(length=x), and length(ds) replaces nbrOfFiles(ds).
 
 
Version: 2.6.11 [2012-11-08]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Renamed getColumnNames() to getDefaultColumnNames() for all classes
   inheriting from GenericTabularFile, because of the new ColumnNamesInterface
   interface.

   latter is now the fastest again.
 
 
Version: 2.6.9 [2012-10-31]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'units' to readDataFrame() for
   AromaUnitChromosomeTabularBinaryFile.
 
 
Version: 2.6.8 [2012-10-29]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now using Arguments$get(Read|Writ)ablePath() instead of
   filePath(..., expandLinks="any").
 
 
Version: 2.6.7 [2012-10-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'maxNAFraction' to CopyNumberChromosomalModel, which
   is now the prefer place to specify it, instead of to fit() etc.
   
 * Now CopyNumberChromosomalModel() accepts references of type
   "none", "constant(1)", "constant(2)", and "median", where "none"
   and "constant(1)" are identical, "constant(2)" uses reference signals
   that are exactly 2, and "median" uses reference signals are equals
   the robust average across all samples.  For backward compatibility,
   NULL is still supported, which equals "median".

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now using Arguments$getWritablePath() everywhere instead
   of mkdirs(), because the former will do a better job in creating
   and asserting directories on slow shared file systems, and when it
   fails it gives a more informative error message.

BUG FIXES:

 * Scrolling in the ChromosomeExplorer by dragging navigator bar was broken.
 
 
Version: 2.6.6 [2012-10-18]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * It is no longer possible to have different *versions* of ArrayExplorer
   and ChromosomeExplorer under the same reports/ directory structure.
   If you wish to keep old Explorer reports, rename those reports/
   root directories.
   
BUG FIXES:

 * Some of the HTML and CSS errors in ArrayExplorer and ChromosomeExplorer
   that were detected by the W3's online validation services were correct.

 * A few errors in the Javascript of ArrayExplorer has been corrected. It also
   does a better job of inferring the height of the displayed spatial image.
   Thanks Laurent Malvert (ID Business Solutions Ltd; IDBS) for the report,
   troubleshooting and suggestions on this.
 
 
Version: 2.6.5 [2012-10-17]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now all static Object methods that calls "next" methods,
   utilizes NextMethod(), which became possible with R.oo v1.10.0.
 
 
Version: 2.6.4 [2012-10-16]

BUG FIXES:

 * ROBUSTNESS/BUG FIX: No longer passing '...' to NextMethod(), cf.
   R-devel thread 'Do *not* pass '...' to NextMethod() - it'll do it
   for you; missing documentation, a bug or just me?' on Oct 16, 2012.
 
 
Version: 2.6.3 [2012-10-14]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Added AromaUnitGcContentFile (from aroma.affymetrix).
 
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * CLEANUP: Removed several defunct/obsolete methods and made
   deprecated methods defunct/obsolete.
 
 
Version: 2.6.2 [2012-10-11]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now aroma.core imports R.methodsS3 and R.oo.  This solves issues such as
   trim() being overridden by ditto from the IRanges package, iff loaded.
 
 
Version: 2.6.1 [2012-09-14]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added exportAromaUnitPscnBinarySet() for a list.

BUG FIXES:

 * exportAromaUnitPscnBinarySet() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet would throw an
   error if the files of the exported data set was ordered in a
   non-lexicographic order.
 
 
Version: 2.6.0 [2012-09-05]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Submitted to CRAN.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * The package passes all redundancy tests.
 
 
Version: 2.5.14 [2012-09-04]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added downloadUGC() for AromaRepository.
 
 
Version: 2.5.13 [2012-09-02]

BUG FIXES:

 * interleave() for Image and RasterImage could generate error 'Error in if
   (abs(vRatio) > abs(hRatio)) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed' if
   odd/even cell intensity columns (rows) contained all NAs.
 
 
Version: 2.5.12 [2012-08-31]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Now downloadCDF() for AromaRepository downloads CDFs regardless of *.cdf
   and *.CDF.
 
 
Version: 2.5.11 [2012-08-29]

NEW FEATURES:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added argument 'escape' to findAnnotationData(), which
   causes such symbols that exist in argument 'pattern' to be
   automatically be escaped.
 
 
Version: 2.5.10 [2012-08-26]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Clarified that when colBinnedSmoothing() is done over zero-length bins,
   the output for those bins will be NA.
   
BUG FIXES:

 * colBinnedSmoothing(..., xOut=xOut) would return binned values in the
   incorrect order, iff 'xOut' was not ordered.  Added a systems test for
   this case.
   
 * colBinnedSmoothing(..., xOut=xOut) could generate bins at the ends that
   did not contain the outer most 'xOut' values.
 
 
Version: 2.5.9 [2012-08-22]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Improved the AromaRepository class.
 
 
Version: 2.5.8 [2012-08-21]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now the package startup message is outputted at the
   very end.  Previously it was done before some additional setup,
   which could potentially fail.

 * ROBUSTNESS: fitWRMA() and fitWHRCModel() now call rcModelWPLM()
   of preprocessCore instead of .Call(..., PACKAGE="preprocessCore").
   Doing so will somewhat slow down the speed, because rcModelWPLM()
   introduces some non-needed validation of the arguments.
   This caused their arguments 'psiCode' and 'psiK' to be dropped.


Version: 2.5.7 [2012-08-08]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added 'preprocessCore' as a suggested package, because
   some of the internal functions rely on that package.  This was never
   an issue, because those functions were called by wrapper functions
   in aroma.affymetrix that assert that the package is indeed loaded.
 
 
Version: 2.5.6 [2012-07-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added exportAromaUnitPscnBinarySet() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet.
 
 * Added alpha versions of classes AromaUnitPscnBinary(File|Set).
 
 * Added getNumberOfFilesAveraged() to AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile.
   Formerly only for AromaUnitTotalCnBinaryFile.
 
 
Version: 2.5.5 [2012-07-17]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Updated package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 2.5.4 [2012-07-10]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now package imports R.devices, because it uses some of its
   device drivers that previously were in R.utils.
 
 
Version: 2.5.3 [2012-06-18]

BUG FIX:

 * Fixed a typo in an error message generated by byChipType() for several
   annotation data file classes.
 
 
Version: 2.5.2 [2012-05-30]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'calculateRatios' to CopyNumberChromosomalModel().

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Updated package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 2.5.1 [2012-04-16]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEANUP: Package now only depends/imports on CRAN package, which
   simplifies the installation of aroma.core, and indirectly any
   packages that depends on it.  Note, there are still "suggested"
   non-CRAN packages, which are required by some/optional methods.
   
 * CLEANUP: Package no longer depends on aroma.light, but instead it
   "suggests" it.  This is possible, because now weightedMad() of
   aroma.light has been added to matrixStats v0.5.0.
   
 * CLEANUP: Package no longer "Suggests" affxparser.  It was needed because
   of the findFiles() function, which has been added to R.utils v1.13.1.
 
 
Version: 2.5.0 [2012-03-25]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Submitted to CRAN.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * The package passes all redundancy tests.
 
 
Version: 2.4.13 [2012-03-23]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added alpha versions of PairedPSCNData and NonPairedPSCNData,
   which inherits from RawGenomicSignals.
   
REFACTORIZATION:

 * Turned weightedMad() into a default method, added help documentation
   with example code.

 * CLEANUP: Moved (internal) swapXY() and draw() for 'density'
   objects to R.utils (>= 1.10.0).

BUG FIXES:

 * "["() for RichDataFrame would loose the class attribute, unless argument
   'drop' was FALSE.
 
 
Version: 2.4.12 [2012-03-15]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now colBinnedSmoothing(), colKernelSmoothing() and colGaussianSmoothing()
   returns a matrix with column names as in argument 'Y'.
   
 * For RawGenomicSignals, added argument 'fields' to binnedSmoothing() and
   binnedSmoothingByField().  Also added argument 'field' to getSignals() and
   estimateStandardDeviation().

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now RawGenomicSignals extends new internal RichDataFrame class.
 
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Dropped deprecated files from the reports/includes/js/ directory installed
   by ArrayExplorer and ChromosomeExplorer.
 
 
Version: 2.4.11 [2012-03-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added binnedSmoothingByField() for RawGenomicSignals.
 
 * Added subset() for RawGenomicSignals.
 
 * Added get- and setVirtualField() for RawGenomicSignals.
 
 * Added argument 'sort' to as.data.frame() for RawGenomicSignals.
 
 
Version: 2.4.10 [2012-03-06]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * GENERALIZATION: The new ArrayExplorer v3.4 will work with most
   commonly used web browsers including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome,
   Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari, and Opera.
 
 
Version: 2.4.9 [2012-03-06]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now all writeDataFrame() methods will add quotation
   marks around column names that contain a comment character ('#').
   This will make the written file readable with read.table() even
   when there are header comments with prefix '#'.  This issue was
   reported by Yu Song at Oakland University.

 * Now createImage() for matrix creates images of type "png::array"
   by default (used to be "EBImage::Image").  If the latter, then
   at least EBImage v3.9.7 (July 2011) is required.

BUG FIXES:

 * write() for RasterImage would write truncated intensities, because we
   forgot to rescale [0,65535] to [0,1] intensities.
 
 
Version: 2.4.8 [2012-03-02]

 * GENERALIZATION: Now RawGenomicSignals inherits from data.frame
   instead of Object.  It works with the big aroma.affymetrix test
   suite as well as with the TCGA vignette (of aroma.cn.eval).
 
 
Version: 2.4.7 [2012-03-01]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added system tests for RawGenomicSignals classes.
 
 * CLEANUP: Now R CMD check no longer reports that the package
   is using .Internal() function calls.  This was due to how we
   adjusted colSums() and colMeans() to become generic functions.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Preparing for RawGenomicSignals not being reference variables.
 
 * Preparing for supporting multiple-chromosome RawGenomicSignals.

 
Version: 2.4.6 [2012-02-04]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Created ChromosomeExplorer v3.4, which should work on even more
   browsers.

NEW FEATURES:

 * GENERALIZATION: Now binnedSmoothing() of RawGenomicSignals default to
   generate the same target bins as binnedSmoothing() of a numeric vector.
   Before the bins had to be specified explicitly by the caller.
   
 * GENERALIZATION: Now it is possible to call colBinnedSmoothing() with
   an empty set of input loci, but still requesting a set of output loci,
   which then will be all missing values.

BUG FIXES:

 * Argument 'x' of colBinnedSmoothing() would default to the incorrect number
   of loci.
 
 
Version: 2.4.5 [2012-02-03]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * GENERALIZATION: As ChromosomeExplorer v3.3, the new ArrayExplorer v3.3
   works with most common web browsers. See below.  However, we still
   have problems getting ArrayExplorer to load the main spatial (PNG)
   image in Internet Explorer.

BUG FIXES:

 * Forgot to include require.js in v2.4.4, which is needed by the
   ChromosomeExplorer v3.3.
 
 
Version: 2.4.4 [2012-02-01]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * GENERALIZATION: The new ChromosomeExplorer v3.3 will work with most
   commonly used web browsers including Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome,
   Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari and Opera.  This far it has
   been tested with the following browsers: Firefox v3.6/v9.01/v10.0,
   Chrome v17.0, IE v7.x/v9.0, and Safari 5.
   NOTE: To update an existing ChromosomeExplorer report, call
   setup(ce, force=TRUE) where 'ce' is your ChromosomeExplorer object.
   Thanks to Keith Ching at ConsultChing for the initial troubleshooting
   [http://consultching.com/root/?p=64] leading me on the right track
   on how update ChromosomeExplorer.
 
 
Version: 2.4.3 [2012-01-17]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now findPngDevice() tries all the available settings for
   argument "type" of png(), for the current platform.  This will
   increase the chances for finding a PNG device that really works.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEANUP: Now findPngDevice() uses isPackageInstalled("Cairo") instead
   of require("Cairo") to avoid loading Cairo if not really used.

PERFORMANCE:

 * SPEEDUP: Now findPngDevice() memoizes the results throughout the
   current session.
 
 
Version: 2.4.2 [2012-01-14]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Added tag 'hg17' to Human,cytobands,hg17,GLADv2.4.0,HB20100219.txt
   in annotationData/genomes/Human/.

BUG FIXES:

 * drawCytoband() for ChromosomalModel failed to locate the genome annotation
   data file containing cytoband information, e.g. Human,cytobands,<tags>.txt.
   Thanks to Kai Wang at Pfizer for reporting on this.
 
 
Version: 2.4.1 [2012-01-12]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package now requires R (>= 2.12.0).

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEANUP: Dropped internal patch of base::serialize(), because it was only
   applied to R (< 2.12.0) anyway and this package now requires R (>= 2.12.0).
 
 
Version: 2.4.0 [2012-01-11]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Aroma settings are no longer loaded during R CMD check.

 * Updated package dependencies.
 
 
Version: 2.3.7 [2011-12-22]

BUG FIXES:

 * The overridden library() would always return an invisible() object, even if
   base::library() wouldn't.  This caused plain library() to not list installed
   packaged.  Thanks Venkat Seshan at MSKCC for reporting on this.
 
 
Version: 2.3.6 [2011-12-15]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now colBinnedSmoothing() handles an unordered 'xOut'.
 
 * Added argument 'units' to writeDateFrame() for AromaUnitSignalBinarySet
   to make it possible to write any subset of units and in any order,
   e.g. genome order.
 
 
Version: 2.3.5 [2011-12-11]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now it is possible to fully specify the location and the width of each bin
   used by colBinnedSmoothing(), which now also returns the bin counts as part
   of the attributes.  Moreover, the bins are now defined to be strictly
   disjoint using boundaries [x0,x1) instead of [x0,x1] as before.
   
 * Added plotCoverageMap() for AromaUgpFile.
 
 
Version: 2.3.4 [2011-11-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added default getDefaultExtension() for UnitAnnotationDataFile,
   which guesses the filename extension from the class name, unless
   overridden by a subclass.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Now byChipType() for UnitAnnotationDataFile and derivatives give an
   error message with more information on which file it failed to
   locate, e.g. by specifying filename extension it looked for.
   
 * CLEANUP: Now getFullNames() for AromaMicroarrayDataSetTuple no
   longer produces a warning on "is.na() applied to non-(list or
   vector) of type 'NULL'".

BUG FIXES:

 * exportTotalCnRatioSet() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet and
   exportFracBDiffSet() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet tried to call
   cat(verbose, x) with length(x) > 1.
 
 
Version: 2.3.3 [2011-11-17]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added trial version of AromaUcscGenomeTextFile.
 
 
Version: 2.3.2 [2011-11-14]

BUG FIXES:

 * process() of ChromosomeExplorer would throw "Error in file(file, 
   ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : [...] cannot open file '/ [...] (new Array(':
   No such file or directory".  Importing the R.rsp namespace in the
   aroma.core namespace solved this. Thanks Qian Liu for reporting on this.
 
 
Version: 2.3.1 [2011-11-11]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added extractPSCNArray() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinary{File|Set}.
 
 
Version: 2.3.0 [2011-10-28]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Added a namespace to the package, which will be more or less
   a requirement starting with R v2.14.0.
 
 
Version: 2.2.2 [2011-09-29]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added alpha version of the AromaRepository class.
 
 
Version: 2.2.1 [2011-09-24]

BUG FIXES:

 * readHeader(), readRawFooter() and writeRawFooter() of
   AromaTabularBinaryFile would try to read non-signed 4-byte integers,
   which is not supported and would instead be read as signed integers.
   From R v2.13.1 this would generated warnings.
 
 
Version: 2.2.0 [2011-09-01]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Submitted to CRAN.
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * The package passes all redundancy tests.
 
 
Version: 2.1.5 [2011-08-30]

BUG FIXES:

 * After introducing a sanity check in aroma.core v2.1.2 (2011-05-11),
   getSnpPositions() of AromaCellSequenceFile would throw
   "Error: length(pos) == ncol(cells) is not TRUE".  However, it was not
   until aroma.core v2.1.3 (2011-08-01) was release that some people got
   problem with this.  It turns out that the sanity check catches an
   error in how getSnpPositions() of AromaCellSequenceFile allocates
   the result vector, a bug that has been there for a very long time.
   Luckily, this bug has had no effect on the results for anyone.
   Thanks to David Goode (Stanford) and Irina Ostrovnaya (MSKCC) for
   reporting on this.
 
 
Version: 2.1.4 [2011-08-02]

BUG FIXES:

 * The aroma.core v2.1.3 tar ball uploaded to CRAN mistakenly
   contained a NAMESPACE file, which shouldn't have been there.
 
 
Version: 2.1.3 [2011-07-27]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * WORKAROUND: In order for the package to work with the most recent
   version of R devel, which automatically add namespaces to packages
   who do not have one, we explicitly have specify that this package
   should use cat() and getOption() of R.utils (instead of 'base').
 
 
Version: 2.1.2 [2011-07-24]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Bumped up the package dependencies, especially since R will
   soon (in practice) require namespaces for all packages.
 
 
Version: 2.1.1 [2011-05-10]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added more sanity checks and more verbose output
   to getSnpNucleotides() for AromaCellSequenceFile.
 
 
Version: 2.1.0 [2011-04-08]

NEW RELEASE:

 * No updates.  Submitted to CRAN.
 
 
Version: 2.0.8 [2011-04-03]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEANUP: Utilizing hpaste() internally wherever applicable.
 
 
Version: 2.0.7 [2011-03-28]

BUG FIXES:

 * allocateFromUnitAnnotationDataFile() for AromaUnitTabularBinaryFile would
   include chip type tags in the path, e.g.
   annotationData/chipTypes/GenomeWidesSNP_6,Full.
 
 
Version: 2.0.6 [2011-03-14]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now ChromosomeExplorer does a better job of listing
   chromosomes that are specific to the genome/organism used.
   
 * Added getChromosomeLabels() for ChromosomeExplorer.
 
 
Version: 2.0.5 [2011-03-04]

BUG FIXES:

 * lapplyInChunks(idxs) for numeric did not correctly handle the case when
   length(idxs) == 0, because of a typo.
 
 
Version: 2.0.4 [2011-03-03]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
 
 * Updated the default filename patterns used by findByGenome() for
   AromaGenomeTextFile to "^%s,chromosomes(|,.*)*[.]txt$".

 * GENERALIZATION: Now findByGenome() for AromaGenomeTextFile follows
   the new aroma search conventions.
   
 * GENERALIZATION: In addition to search <rootPath>/<set>/<name> paths,
   findAnnotationData() can also search <rootPath>/<set>/ by not
   specifying argument 'name' (or setting it to NULL).  Also, if it
   cannot locate any files, it falls back to annotation data available
   in any of the aroma.* packages.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now getGenomeFile() for ChromosomalModel utilizes byGenome() for
   AromaGenomeTextFile to locate the genome annotation file.
   
 * Added static loadAll() for SampleAnnotationSet.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added a return contract/sanity check asserting that
   getUnitsOnChromosomes() for AromaUnitChromosomeTabularBinaryFile
   truly returns valid 'unit' indices.  Thanks to Emilie Sohier,
   France for reporting on a problem related to this.
 
 
Version: 2.0.3 [2011-03-02]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
 
 * STANDARDIZATION: Now the default output path for all
   allocateFromUnitAnnotationDataFile() is
   annotationData/chipTypes/<chipType>/.  Before it was the same
   directory as the original annotation data file, which may for
   instance have been in a deeper subdirectory, or recently also
   in a sibling root path.
   
 * GENERALIZATION: getAverageFile() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet first
   searches for an existing result file according to the new search
   conventions.  If not found, then it's created.

 * GENERALIZATION: Now the default for createImage() for matrix is to
   test to create images according to aroma settings option
   'output/ImageClasses'.
   
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now getAverageFile() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet creates
   the result file atomically by writing to a temporary file which is
   renamed afterward.
   
 * Now write() and read() for RasterImage throws an informative error
   message explaining that the 'png' package is needed.

BUG FIXES:

 * colorize() for Image would throw '<simpleError in ...: could not find
   function "colorMode">', because the colorMode() function needs to be
   explicitly imported after the recent package cleanups.
   
 * colorize() for Image tried to call createImage() using a vector instead
   of a matrix.
   
 * createImage() for matrix would not return the first possible image created
   (when testing different image classes) but instead continue trying to create
   image for all possible classes.  For instance, this meant that although you
   had the 'EBImage' package installed, but not the 'png' package, it would
   still in the end try to (also) use 'png' package.  If writing PNG images to
   file, say via ArrayExplorer, this would result in "Error in 
   loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called 'png'".  Thanks Richard
   Beyer at University of Washington for reporting on this.
 
 
Version: 2.0.2 [2011-02-19]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
 
 * GENERALIZATION: Extended the default root paths of findAnnotationData()
   to be annotationData/ and annotationData,<tags>/
 
 
Version: 2.0.1 [2011-02-19]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEANUP: Moved static getTags() to Arguments to R.filesets v0.9.3.
 
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Deprecated static method importFromTable() for FileMatrix.
 
 * Removed several deprecated methods.
 
 
Version: 2.0.0 [2011-02-16]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Submitted to CRAN.
 
 * No updates.


Version: 1.9.4 [2011-02-07]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * CLARIFICATION: Now the exception thrown by getRawCopyNumbers() for
   CopyNumberSegmentationModel, when there are too many non-finite
   signals, gives a more informative error message containing
   information also on which sample, reference and chromosome the
   problem was detected on.

BUG FIXES:

 * Now fit() for CopyNumberSegmentationModel passes down argument
   'maxNAFraction' to the internal sanity test as it used to do before
   aroma.core v1.3.4 (November 2009).
 
 
Version: 1.9.3 [2011-02-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * GENERALIZATION: Now spatial PNG image files can also be created
   utilizing the 'png' package as an alternative to the 'EBImage'
   package.  The EBImage package can be tricky to install on
   some OSes, e.g. Windows 7 64-bit.
   
 * Added alpha version of an internal RasterImage class.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Added an internal writeImage() for Image objects as defined by
   the EBImage package.  This made it possible to remove the remaining
   explicit dependencies on EBImage in the aroma.affymetrix package.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Removed some remaining partial argument calls.
 
DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

 * Deprecated internal as.TrueColorImage() for Image and for matrices.
 
 * Removed deprecated internal rgbTransform() for Image.
 
 
Version: 1.9.2 [2011-01-30]

PERFORMANCE:

 * SPEEDUP: The memoization/caching mechanisms should now be faster
   on Windows, because digest() uses the faster serialize() of
   R v2.12.0.  The earlier version was orders of magnitude slower
   on Windows, which we have been patching in the aroma framework
   since v0.9.3.4.  That patch wrote to file, which was slower than
   the recent fix.  This Windows-only patch is no longer needed,
   and hence neither applied, on R v2.12.0 and beyond.
 
 
Version: 1.9.1 [2011-01-14]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
 
 * Added argument 'flavor' to segmentByGLAD() for RawGenomicSignals,
   which makes it possible to specify whether daglad() or glad() of
   the GLAD package will be used.  The 'flavor' argument can also
   be passed as for instance GladModel(..., flavor="daglad").
 
 
Version: 1.9.0 [2011-01-10]

NEW RELEASE:

 * No updates.  Submitted to CRAN.
 
 
Version: 1.8.3 [2010-12-27]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added genome annotation file Mouse,chromosomes.txt to
   system.file("annotationData/genomes/Mouse", package="aroma.core").
 
 
Version: 1.8.2 [2010-12-07]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Whenever the GLAD package is tried to be loaded and it
   fails due to failure of loading a shared library, then this will be
   remembered for 24 hours while it will not be loaded again.
 
 * Added requireWithMemory().

 
Version: 1.8.1 [2010-12-02]

BUG FIXES:

 * plot() for CopyNumberSegmentationModel would throw exception "Cannot infer
   number of bases in chromosome. No such chromosome: 25" for chromosome 25.
   
 * drawCytoband2() would throw an error if argument 'cytoband' was an empty
   data frame, which could happen if there is no cytoband annotation data for
   the requested chromosome.  Now it returns quietly.
 
 
Version: 1.8.0 [2010-11-07]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Committed to CRAN.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEANUP: Dropped non-used Javascript toolkit code that was intended
   to be used for a future version of ChromosomeExplorer.
 
 
Version: 1.7.6 [2010-11-06]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now subsample() for BinnedScatter utilizes resample().

 * CLEANUP: Removed stext().  It is in R.utils.
 
 * CLEANUP: Removed some outdated patches for R v2.7.0 and before.
 
 * CLEANUP: Package no longer need to "suggest" geneplotter.
 
 
Version: 1.7.5 [2010-10-25]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now fit() for CopyNumberSegmentationModel also passed the optional
   arguments ('...') passed to the constructor function.  This makes it
   possible to specify all arguments while initiating the model, e.g.
   sm <- CbsModel(..., min.width=5, alpha=0.05).
   
 * Now optional arguments '...' to CopyNumberChromosomalModel are recorded.
 
 
Version: 1.7.4 [2010-10-13]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS/BUG FIX: The internal drawCytoband2() used to annotate
   chromosomal plots with cytobands tries to utilize GLAD package,
   if available.  However, even when GLAD is installed it may still be
   broken due to missing dynamic libraries, e.g. 'Error in
   library.dynam(lib, package, package.lib) : DLL 'GLAD' not found: maybe
   not installed for this architecture?'.  We now avoid this too.
 
 
Version: 1.7.3 [2010-09-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added drawDensity() for CopyNumberRegions and RawGenomicSignals.

 * Added getDensity() for CopyNumberRegions which returns the
   empirical density of the mean levels weighted by the region lengths.

 * Added getLength() for CopyNumberRegions, which returns a vector
   of region lengths.

 * Now the ylim defaults to c(0,5) for plot() for RawCopyNumbers.

 * Added basic support for operators +, - and * to RawGenomicSignals.
 
 
Version: 1.7.2 [2010-08-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added the AromaGenomeTextFile class.

 * Added genome annotation file Canine,chromosomes,UGP,HB20100822.txt to
   system.file("annotationData/genomes/Canine", package="aroma.core").

BUG FIXES:

 * annotationData/genomes/Human/Human,chromosomes.txt had an extra TAB on
   the ChrM row.
 
 
Version: 1.7.1 [2010-08-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added abstract classes SegmentationDataFile and SegmentationDataSet
   to represent segmentation data results.  Current subclasses are
   CbsSegmentationData(File|Set).

 * Added more utility methods for CopyNumberRegions.
 
 
Version: 1.7.0 [2010-07-26]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Committed to CRAN. No updates.
 
 
Version: 1.6.8 [2010-07-24]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added several methods for CopyNumberRegions, e.g. xRange(), prune(),
   simulateRawCopyNumbers(), "+"(), "-"() and "*"().
 
 
Version: 1.6.7 [2010-07-20]

BUG FIXES:

 * Added writeDataFrame() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet and
   AromaUnitFracBCnBinarySet to get the correct filename extension.
   Thanks Nicolas Vergne at the Curie Institute for reporting this.
 
 
Version: 1.6.6 [2010-07-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added subset() for CopyNumberRegions.

 * Now extractRegion() for RawGenomicSignals also accepts a
   CopyNumberRegions object for argument 'regions'.

 * Added extractRegions() for RawGenomicSignals.
 
 
Version: 1.6.5 [2010-07-08]

BUG FIXES:

 * writeDateFrame() for AromaUnitSignalBinarySet would write the same data
   chunk over and over.
 
 
Version: 1.6.4 [2010-07-06]

BUG FIXES:

 * indexOf() for ChromosomalModel would return NA if a search pattern contained
   parenthesis '(' and ')'.  There was a similar issue in indexOf() for
   GenericDataFileSet/List in R.filesets, which was solved in R.filesets 0.8.3.
   Now indexOf() for ChromosomalModel utilizes ditto for GenericDataFileSet for
   its solution.
 
 
Version: 1.6.3 [2010-06-22]

BUG FIXES:

 * as.GrayscaleImage(..., transforms=NULL) for 'matrix' would throw
   "Exception: Argument 'transforms' contains a non-function: NULL".
 
 
Version: 1.6.2 [2010-06-02]

BUG FIXES:

 * updateDataColumn() of AromaTabularBinaryFile would censor *signed integers*
   incorrectly; it should censor at/to [-(n+1),n], but did it at [-n,(n+1)]
   ("two's complement").  This caused it to write too large values as n+1,
   which then would be read as -(n+1), e.g. writing 130 would be censored to
   128 (should be 127), which then would be read as -128. Added more detailed
   information on how many values were censored.
   Thanks Robert Ivanek for report on this.
 
 
Version: 1.6.1 [2010-05-27]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added trial version of fullname translator files.

 * doCBS() for character:s support data set tuples.

 * Added doCBS() for CopyNumberDataSetTuple:s.
 
 
Version: 1.6.0 [2010-05-14]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Package submitted to CRAN.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.11.0 and v2.12.0 devel.
 
 
Version: 1.5.8 [2010-05-13]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
 
 * Now argument 'path' of all writeDataFrame() methods defaults
   to <rootPath>,txt/<dataSet>/<chipType>/.
 
 
Version: 1.5.7 [2010-04-27]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added writeDataFrame() for AromaUnitTabularBinaryFile.

 * Added argument 'columnNamesPrefix' to all writeDataFrame().

 * AD HOC: Now getUnitAnnotationDataFile() of AromaPlatformInterface
   load aroma.affymetrix if needed and if installed.
 
 
Version: 1.5.6 [2010-04-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added writeDataFrame() for AromaUnitSignalBinary{File|Set}.
 
 
Version: 1.5.5 [2010-04-12]

BUG FIXES:

 * getFitFunction() of CbsModel would return a function that would give
   "Error in segmentByCBS.RawGenomicSignals(..., seed = seed): formal argument
   "seed" matched by multiple actual arguments".
 
 
Version: 1.5.4 [2010-04-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added equals() for CopyNumberRegions.

 * Added argument 'seed' to CbsModel, which will, if specified, set
   the random seed (temporarily) each time (per sample and chromosome)
   before calling the segmentation method.
 
 
Version: 1.5.3 [2010-04-05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'seed' to segmentByCBS() for RawGenomicSignals.
 
 
Version: 1.5.2 [2010-03-29]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Increased the requirements of support packages.
 
 
Version: 1.5.1 [2010-03-02]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
 
 * CHANGE: Argument 'arrays' of doCBS() for CopyNumberDataSet no longer
   subset the input data set, but instead is passed to the fit() function
   of the segmentation model.  This way all arrays in the input data set
   are still used for calculating the pooled reference.
   
 * Now segmentByMPCBS() can be used to segment data from a single source.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added more sanity checks to segmentByMPCBS() for
   RawGenomicSignals.

BUG FIXES:

 * Forgot argument 'verbose' of getOutputSet() of ChromosomalModel.
 
 
Version: 1.5.0 [2010-02-22]

Version: 1.4.7 [2010-02-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added the AromaCellCpgFile class.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Added Rd help for AromaCellPositionFile class.
 
 
Version: 1.4.6 [2010-02-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Argument 'zooms' of ChromosomeExplorer now default to 2^(0:6),
   instead of 2^(0:7), because the images for zoom 2^7=128 would not
   display in Firefox for the largest chromosomes.

 * Updated getGenomeFile() for ChromosomalModel such that it can be used
   to locate other types of genome annotation files as well, files that
   may be optional (without giving an error).

 * Added Human cytoband files to annotationData/genomes/.

 * Added annotationData/genomes/ to aroma.core (from aroma.affymetrix).

 * Added getOutputSet() for ChromosomalModel.

 * Added alpha version of a doCBS().
 
SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * SIMPLIFICATION: Now it is possible to use ChromosomeExplorer without
   having to install the GLAD package (used before for cytobands).

 * SIMPLIFICATION: Now it is possible to plot cytobands without having
   to install the GLAD package.

 
Version: 1.4.5 [2010-02-10]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now also patches for R.filesets and R.utils are loaded,
   if available, when aroma.core is loaded.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEANUP: Removed debug print() statements in isCompatibleWith().
 
 
Version: 1.4.4 [2010-02-03]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Package now requires matrixStats v0.1.9 or newer,
   due to a bug in the earlier versions that would affect smoothing
   of chromosomal signals that contains missing values.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check and all redundancy tests.
 
 
Version: 1.4.3 [2010-01-25]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added a sanity check getChromosomes() for class
   AromaUnitChromosomeTabularBinaryFile validating that the file
   has a 'chromosome' column.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEANUP: Using new Arguments$getTags() where ever possible.
 
 
Version: 1.4.2 [2010-01-13]

NEW FEATURES:

 * ChromosomalModel:s (and and the ChromosomeExplorer) no
   longer require unit names files.

 * getListOfAromaUgpFiles() for ChromosomalModel no longer goes via
   getListOfUnitNamesFiles().  This opens up the possibility to work
   with data files without unit names files, e.g. smoothed CN data.

 * Added getAromaUgpFile() for AromaPlatformInterface.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Now getUnitNamesFile() for AromaPlatformInterface utilizes the
   generic getUnitAnnotationDataFile() method.
 
 
Version: 1.4.1 [2010-01-06]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'defaults' to allocate() of AromaTabularBinaryFile.
 
 
Version: 1.4.0 [2010-01-04]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added trial version of segmentByMPCBS() via the 'mpcbs' package.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.10.1 and R v2.11.0 devel and
   all of its redundancy tests.

BUG FIXES:

 * Added getDefaultFullName() for AromaMicroarrayDataSet and
   AromaTabularBinarySet in order to override (parent=1) the new default
   of GenericDataFileSet in R.filesets v0.7.0, which would return the
   chip type (parent=0) as the name.
 
 
Version: 1.3.8 [2010-01-02]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getPairedNames() to CopyNumberChromosomalModel which returns
   combined '<test>vs<ref>' names, e.g. 'TumorvsNormal'.  The default
   behavior is that if <ref> is the average of a pool, then the
   paired name is '<test>', e.g. 'Tumor'.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEAN UP: Moved all GenericSummary code to R.utils.
 
 
Version: 1.3.7 [2010-01-01]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'pattern' to byName() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet
   and AromaUnitFracBCnBinarySet.

 * getSets() of AromaMicroarrayDataSetTuple overrides the default method
   by adding the chip types as the names of the returns list.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Using new Arguments$getInstanceOf() were possible.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now CopyNumberChromosomalModel() asserts that none of the
   test samples have duplicated names.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now all index arguments are validated correctly
   using the new 'max' argument of Arguments$getIndices().  Before
   the case where "max == 0" was not handled correctly.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEAN UP: Removed getSetTuple() from ChromosomeExplorer.

BUG FIXES:

 * translateFullNames() of ChromosomeExplorer would translate the full names,
   but return the original ones.

 * getFullNames() of ChromosomeExplorer reported: Error in
   UseMethod("translateFullNames") : no applicable method for
   'translateFullNames' applied to an object of class "character".
 
 
Version: 1.3.6 [2009-12-08]

BUG FIXES:

 * extractMatrix() of AromaUnitCallFile did not recognize NoCalls.
 
 
Version: 1.3.5 [2009-12-02]

BUG FIXES:

 * extractRawCopyNumbers() for RawCopyNumbers would give an error if the
   internal logBase was NULL.
 
 
Version: 1.3.4 [2009-11-24]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
 
 * Now all chromosome plot functions have xScale=1e-6 by default.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added extractRawCopyNumbers(, ...logBase=2) to RawCopyNumbers,
   which can be used to change the logarithmic base of CN ratios,
   if any.

 * Added getAverageFile() for AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Moved ChromosomeExplorer to aroma.core from aroma.affymetrix.

 * Moved several method for 'profileCGH' objects to aroma.core
   from aroma.affymetrix.


Version: 1.3.3 [2009-11-19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * ALPHA: First successful run of segmentation with CbsModel
   with AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySet data sets.

 * Added isAverageFile() for AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile.

 * Added class AromaUnitTotalCnBinarySetTuple.

 * Added interfaces CopyNumberDataFile, CopyNumberDataSet,
   and CopyNumberDataSetTuple (internal for now).
 
REFACTORIZATION:

 * GENERALIZATION: Moved CbsModel, GladModel and HaarSegModel
   (all segmentation models) of aroma.affymetrix to here.

 * GENERALIZATION: Moved all (generalized) ChromosomalModel,
   CopyNumberChromosomalModel, and CopyNumberSegmentationModel
   from aroma.affymetrix to here.

 
Version: 1.3.2 [2009-11-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getAromaUflFile() to UnitAnnotationDataFile.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Moved AromaUflFile to aroma.core (from aroma.affymetrix).

BUG FIXES:

 * Now AromaUflFile$allocateFromUnitNamesFile() works.

 * importFrom(ufl, dat, ...) where 'ufl' was an AromaUflFile and 'dat' a
   GenericTabularFile gave an error reporting that
   importFromGenericTabularFile() is abstract/not defined for AromaUflFile:s.
   Thanks Paolo Guarnieri for reporting this.
 
 
Version: 1.3.1 [2009-11-03]

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Replaced Rd cross references to sfit and HaarSeg packages with
   plain text in order to meet the CRAN requirements that all
   Rd links must exist on the CRAN servers.
 
 
Version: 1.3.0 [2009-11-01]

NEW RELEASE:

 * New public release.

 * More recent dependencies on Bioconductor packages.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.10.0 and all redundancy tests.
 
 
Version: 1.2.3 [2009-10-25]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getExtensionPattern() to most GenericDataFile classes.
 
 
Version: 1.2.2 [2009-10-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added setName() for RawGenomicSignals.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Stricter dependencies.
 
 
Version: 1.2.1 [2009-10-02]

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEAN UP: Updated to use byPath() instead fromFiles().

 * CLEAN UP: Move the Interface class to the R.oo package.
 
 
Version: 1.2.0 [2009-09-09]

NEW RELEASE:

 * New public release.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.9.2 and all redundancy tests.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Fixed broken/missing Rd links.

 
Version: 1.1.7 [2009-09-07]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:
 
 * Now getUnitsOnChromosomes() for AromaUnitChromosomeTabularBinaryFile
   returns a vector by default (unlist=TRUE).
 
 
Version: 1.1.6 [2009-09-07]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added yRange(), yMin() and yMax() for RawGenomicSignals.

 * Added extractRawCopyNumbers() for RawSequenceReads.

BUG FIXES:

 * BUG FIX/WORKAROUND: smoothScatter(), which is used in for
   instance aroma.affymetrix, is in the graphics package from
   R v2.9.0.  It was previously in geneplotter v1.2.4 and before(!).
   The code imported it from geneplotter would therefore give an
   error of a missing function with geneplotter v1.2.5.  We
   are now assuming R v2.9.0 by default, but if not available,
   but geneplotter v1.2.4 or earlier is, geneplotter is loaded.
   If neither are available, a dummy smoothScatter() is setup
   reporting an error.
 
 
Version: 1.1.5 [2009-08-29]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Added totalAndFracBData/ to the search path of byName() for
   AromaUnit(FracB|Total)CnBinarySet.
 
 
Version: 1.1.4 [2009-07-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added allocateFromUnitAnnotationDataFile() for
   AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile and AromaUnitTabularBinaryFile.

 * Added getUnitTypesFile() for AromaPlatform and AromaPlatformInterface.

 * Added UnitAnnotationDataFile, which now the UnitNamesFile and the new
   UnitTypesFile inherits from.

 * Now uses() for Interface takes multiple Interface:s.
 
 
Version: 1.1.3 [2009-07-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added class RawSequenceReads.

 * Added support for argument 'byCount' to binnedSmoothingByState() of
   SegmentedCopyNumbers.  It is rather complex how it works, but we tried
   to immitate how it works with byCount=FALSE.

 * Now binnedSmoothing() of RawGenomicSignals demark locus fields
   that were not binned to be regular fields.  Ideally all locus fields
   (including custom ones) should be binned, but we leave that for a
   future implementation.

 * Added get-, setStateColorMap(), and getStateColors() for class
   SegmentedGenomicSignalsInterface.
 
 
Version: 1.1.2 [2009-06-14]

NEW RELEASE:

 * This is the first version of aroma.core on CRAN.
 
NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument keepUnits=FALSE to extractRawGenomicSignals() of
   AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile.

 * Now RawGenomicSignals(y=rgs) sets all locus fields in 'rgs' if it is
   a RawGenomicSignals object.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Updated examples() that requires "suggested" packages to be ran
   conditionally, so that it does not throw an error (in R CMD check)
   if the packages is not available.  This is required for a package
   to be put on CRAN.

BUG FIXES:

 * exportTotalCnRatioSet() would return a AromaUnitFracBCnBinarySet.

 
Version: 1.1.1 [2009-06-10]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * GRAMMAR FIX: is(Homo|Hetero)zygous(), not is(Homo|Hetero)zygote().
 
NEW FEATURES:

 * ADDED: Added support for "birdseed" encoding in extractGenotypes()
   and updateGenotypes() of AromaUnitGenotypeCallFile.

 * Added SegmentedGenomicSignalsInterface, which implements all the
   methods for SegmentedCopyNumbers and the new SegmentedAlleleBFractions.

 * Added getFields() to Interface as an ad hoc solutions to avoid
   print(<Interface>) throwing 'Error in UseMethod("getFields") : no
   applicable method for "getFields"'.

PERFORMANCE:

 * SPEEDUP: updateGenotypes() of AromaUnitGenotypeCallFile is now much
   faster in counting A:s and B:s.

BUG FIXES:

 * isHomozygote() of AromaUnitGenotypeCallFile was not correct.

 * getOutputDataSet() of AromaTransform failed to identify the output files if
   (and only if) a filename translator was applied to the input data set.
 
 
Version: 1.1.0 [2009-05-29]

NEW RELEASE:

 * New public release.
 
 * No updates.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.9.0 and all redundancy tests.
 
 
Version: 1.0.8 [2009-05-25]

NEW FEATURES:

 * GENERALIZATION: The AromaTransforms class was generalized further
   to handle cases where the number of output files does not map
   one to one to the input files.
 
 
Version: 1.0.7 [2009-05-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added extractRawAlleleBFractions() for AromaUnitFracBCnBinaryFile.

 * Added exportFracBDiffSet() for AromaUnitFracBCnBinarySet.

 * ADDED: Now all segmentByNnn() for RawGenomicSignals also returns
   so called 'aromaEstimates', which are additional parameter
   estimates, e.g. robust estimates of the standard deviation of
   all full-resolution CNs as well as per identified region.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now allocate() for AromaTabularBinaryFile first allocates
   a temporary file which is then renamed.  This makes the file allocation
   more atomic, and therefore less error prone to interrupts etc.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now indexOf() for UnitNamesFile assert that exactly one
   of the 'pattern' and 'names' arguments is given.  It also gives an
   informative error message if 'pattern' is a vector.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now all arguments that are expected to be exactly one
   character string (not an empty vector or a vector of length two)
   are asserted to be that too.  This closes some potential bugs.

 * EXCEPTION HANDLING: All methods that modifies an existing file, are
   now asserting that the file permissions allow modifying it, and if not
   gives a clear error message that this is the case.

PERFORMANCE:

 * MEMORY OPTIMIZATION: Where ever possible/applicable, we now use
   Arguments$getNumerics(), which, in R utils v1.1.5 and new, corces
   to doubles only if the input is not already doubles.  This will
   lower the memory usage in some cases since an integers use 4 bytes
   and doubles 8 bytes.  This also save disk space if object is saved
   to disk, e.g. a DNAcopy fit object with integer genomic positions
   instead of double ones, save approx 5-7% disk space.

REFACTORIZATION:

 * Moved the Explorer class and its support files under inst/ from
   aroma.affymetrix to aroma.core.

 * Moved the AromaCellPositionFile class from aroma.affymetrix
   to aroma.core.

 * CLEAN UP: Moved all file set specific classes and methods to
   the new R.filesets package.

BUG FIXES:

 * allocateFromUnitNamesFile() for AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile would not call
   generic allocate() but the one for this class.

 * extractMergedRawCopyNumbers(..., unshift=TRUE) would estimate the relative
   shifts between platforms using smoothed CNs over the genomic region defined
   by the first data set.  Now it is done over the region defined by the union
   of all data sets.  The impact of this bug should be neglectable or zero.
 
 
Version: 1.0.6 [2009-05-14]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now binnedSmoothing() of RawGenomicSignals uses weighted estimates
   (by default) if weights exists.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added RawAlleleBFractions() extending RawGenomicSignals.

 * Added extractCopyNumberRegions() for profileCGH, DNAcopy, and
   HaarSeg segmentation object. Before they were in aroma.affymetrix.

 * Added segmentByCBS(), segmentByGLAD(), and segmentByHarSeeg()
   to RawGenomicSignals, which all support weights if the underlying
   segmentation method does.  To date, it is only CBS and HaarSeg
   that supports weights.  These methods also support memoization.

 * Added extractRegion() to RawGenomicSignals.

 * Added getWeights() and hasWeights() to RawGenomicSignals.

 * Added {add,subtract,multiply,divide}By() for RawGenomicSignals all
   utilizing support method applyBinaryOperator().

 * ALPHA: Added classes GenericDataFile{Set}List.

 * ALPHA: Added class AromaUnitTotalCnBinaryFileList with methods
   extractRawCopyNumbers() and extractMergedRawCopyNumbers().

PERFORMANCE:

 * SPEEDUP: Now TextUnitNamesFile caches all unit names in memory.

BUG FIXES:

 * Now aroma.core works with the IRanges and grid packages, regardless on the
   order they were loaded.

 * getPlatform() of TextUnitNamesFile would sometimes return a list of length
   one, instead of an single character string.

 * extractSubset() of RawGenomicSignals did not recognize all locus fields.
 
 
Version: 1.0.5 [2009-05-10]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now getOutputDataSet() of AromaTransform returns a data set with files
   ordered such that the fullnames are ordered the same way as the input
   data set.  Suggested by Xin (Victoria) Wang at UC Berkeley.

 * Now getOutputDataSet() of AromaTransform scans for the output data
   files with fullnames matching those of the input data set.  This is
   one step closer to being able to batch process subsets of data sets
   when the method is, say, a single-array method.

 * UPDATE: Replace argument 'robust' of colBinnedSmoothing()
   with a more generic 'FUN' argument.  The default arguments
   give identical results.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now static fromFiles() of GenericDataFileSet supports empty data sets.

 * Now readDataFrame() of AromaUgpFile and AromaUnitTabularBinaryFile
   accepts rows=integer(0).

 * Added abstract class AromaUnitChromosomeTabularBinaryFile to make it
   easier to setup up new annotation file formats based on chromosomes.
   AromaUgpFile is now inheriting from this class.
   getUnitsOnChromosomes() now returns a list stratified by chromosome.

 * Added extractByChromosomes() for AromaUgpFile.

 * Added argument 'translate' to getColumnNames() of TabularTextFile.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.9.0.

BUG FIXES:

 * Our internal interleave() for Image (defined by EBImage) gave 'Error in
   z[idxOdd,, ] : incorrect number of dimensions'. This was because internal
   image structure of the Image class changed (back) to being a 2-dim array.
   Now interleave() handles both 2d and 3d arrays.

 * lines() of RawGenomicSignals did not recognize x/yScale.

 * as.character() of GenericDataFile would throw 'Error in sprintf("%d",
   getFileSize(db, "numeric")) : use format %f, %e, %g or %a for numeric
   objects' whenever the file size is returned as a double, which happens
   for very large files (> 2^31-1 bytes).

 * as.character() of GenericDataFileSet would throw an error if the data set
   was empty, because then there was no path.
 
 
Version: 1.0.4 [2009-04-07]

BUG FIXES:

 * getUnitNames(..., units=NULL) of TextUnitNamesFile would make the object
   believe there are zero units in the file.  Thanks Shermane Teo at the
   National University of Singapore for reporting this.

 * binnedSmoothing(..., byCount=TRUE) of RawGenomicSignals would give error
   "[...] object "ys" not found".

 * When passing a single data points to colBinnedSmoothing(), it would throw
   the exception: "Range of argument 'by' is out of range [0,0]: [<by>,<by>]".
 
 
Version: 1.0.3 [2009-03-23]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added the TextUnitNamesFile class.
 
 
Version: 1.0.2 [2009-02-26]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'units' to extractRawCopyNumbers() of
   AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile.

 * Added RawGenomicSignals which RawCopyNumbers now inherits from.

 * Added readDataFrame(..., units=NULL) to AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile.

 * Added optional argument/field 'name' to RawCopyNumbers, which
   is also used by SegmentedCopyNumbers when querying the "truth"
   function(s) for the copy-number state.  This makes it possible
   to use one (conditional) truth functions for all samples.

 * Added hasBeenModified() to GenericDataFile.

 * Now hasTags(..., tags) of GenericData{File|Set} splits the
   'tags' argument.

 * Now RawCopyNumbers() takes RawCopyNumbers objects as input.

 * Now as.character() of GenericDataFile also reports the exact file
   size in case the file size is reported in kB, MB, etc.  It also
   tries to report the relative pathname rather than the absolute.
 
PERFORMANCE:

 * Now getChecksum() of GenericDataFile caches results unless the
   file has been modified since last time.

 
Version: 1.0.1 [2009-02-12]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now byName() of AromaUnit(FracB|Total)CnBinarySet searches
   rawCnData/ then cnData/.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added SegmentedCopyNumbers class.

 * Added various smoothing methods to RawCopyNumbers.

 * Added colBinnedSmoothing() and colKernelSmoothing().

 * Added getAromaUgpFile() to UnitNamesFile.

 * Added shakyText().

 * Added static byChipType() to UnitNamesFile.

 * Added argument 'fullname' to getChipType() of AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile.

 * Now argument 'files' in extract() of GenericDataFileSet can
   also be a vector of string.

 * ALPHA: Added support for "smart" (e.g. "*") subdirectories in static
   findByName() of GenericDataFileSet.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added support for optional validation/selection by the
   number of units/cells to all static byChipType() methods.  This is
   done by specifying argument nbrOfUnits/nbrOfCells.  This is intend
   for internal use only.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Added a sanity check to getAromaUgpFile() of
   UnitNamesFile and AromaUnitSignalBinaryFile, which asserts that
   the number of units in the located UGP file match that the number
   of units in the data file.

 * ROBUSTNESS: Now findAnnotationData() always returns pathnames
   ordered by the length of their fullnames. Before this was only
   done if 'firstOnly=TRUE'.
 
 
Version: 1.0.0 [2009-01-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getMaxLengthRepeats() to AromaCellSequenceFile.

 * Added AromaUnitSignalBinary{File|Set}, AromaUnitTotalCnBinary{File|Set},
   AromaUnitFracBCnFinary{File|Set}, AromaUnitCall{File|Set}, and
   AromaUnitGenotypeCall{File|Set}.

BUG FIXES:

 * readFooter() of AromaTabularBinaryFile did not return the correct list for
   nested structures.

 * groupBySnpNucleotides() of AromaCellSequenceFile would return an empty
   element 'missing' for some chip types, e.g. Mapping10K_Xba142.  Now such
   empty elements are dropped.

 * getAttributes() for GenericDataFile:s would give an error if there were no
   attributes.
 
 
Version: 0.9.6 [2008-12-04]

NEW FEATURES:

 * ALPHA: Added the BinnedScatter class with methods.

PERFORMANCE:

 * SPEEDUP: Now predict() of ProbePositionEffects is 6-7 times faster.

 * SPEEDUP: Now the result of isMissing() for AromaCellSequenceFile
   can be cached.

BUG FIXES:

 * CLEAN UP: readDataFrame() of AromaTabularBinaryFile would forget to
   close the connection if verbose output was activated.  When R later
   would close such connections, a warning would be generated.
 
 
Version: 0.9.5 [2008-10-17]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.7.2 and R v2.8.0rc.
 
 
Version: 0.9.4.5 [2008-10-16]

BUG FIXES:

 * Tried to turn a function passed to as.GrayscaleImage() in argument
   'transforms' to a list using as.list() and not list().
 
 
Version: 0.9.4.4 [2008-09-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added argument 'skip' to writeChecksum() of GenericDataFile.
 
 
Version: 0.9.4.3 [2008-09-03]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getSnpPositions(), getSnpShifts(), getSnpNucleotides() and
   groupBySnpNucleotides() to AromaCellSequenceFile.
 
 
Version: 0.9.4.2 [2008-08-31]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Update fitGenotypeCone() to support both flavors 'sfit' (old)
   and 'expectile' (new).
 
 
Version: 0.9.4.1 [2008-08-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added support for argument 'positions' to countBases() for
   AromaCellSequenceFile.

 * ALPHA: Added fitMultiDimensionalCone().

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * TESTING: Added redundancy tests to aroma.core.

BUG FIXES:

 * readSequences() for AromaCellSequenceFile translated raw values to incorrect
   nucleotides.
 
 
Version: 0.9.4 [2008-08-02]

NEW RELEASE:

 * Public release.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.7.1 and R v2.8.0 devel on WinXP.
 
 
Version: 0.9.3.4 [2008-07-24]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added getCreatedOn(), getLastModifiedOn(), and getLastAccessedOn() to
   GenericDataFile.  These a just wrapper accessing file.info() fields.

PERFORMANCE:

 * SPEEDUP: Added patch for base::serialize() on Windows, which in turn will
   speed up digest::digest() and all methods that use the latter to generate
   hashcodes.

 * SPEEDUP: Now as.character() for GenericTabularFile:s and TabularTextFile:s
   reports the number of data rows and the number of text lines as NA if the
   files are too large and cached results are not already available.

 * SPEEDUP: Replaced all which() with faster whichVector().
 
 
Version: 0.9.3.3 [2008-07-21]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Now updateDataColumn() coerce values to doubles before censoring them for
   raw and integer columns.

NEW FEATURES:

 * Now countBases() of AromaCellSequenceFile returns "raw" counts if argument
   'mode="raw"'.

 * ALPHA: Added setFullName() and setName() to GenericDataFile and
   GenericDataFileSet. The plan is to have these replace what getAlias() and
   setAlias() do today.

 * BETA: Added setFullNameTranslator() to GenericDataFileSet.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Now findByName() assert that the data set name is not empty.

 
Version: 0.9.3.2 [2008-07-16]

NEW FEATURES:

 * BETA: Added setFullNamesTranslator() (for the files) to AromaGenericFileSet.

NEW FEATURES:

 * ALPHA: Added protected update2() to GenericDataFileSet.

 * ALPHA: Added private ProbePositionEffects et al.
 
 
Version: 0.9.3.1 [2008-07-12]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added a general importFrom() for AromaTabularBinaryFile, which calls
   matching importFrom<ClassName>(), if found.

 * Added support for 'raw' data columns in AromaTabularBinaryFile.

 * BETA: Added readTableHeader().

 * BETA: Added AromaCellSequenceFile.

 * BETA: Added classes AromaMicroarrayTabularBinaryFile and
   AromaCellTabularBinaryFile.

PERFORMANCE:

 * SPEEDUP: Now all AromaTabularBinaryFile:s, such as AromaUgpFile,
   read data much faster after two modifications to readDataFrame():
   (i) rownames are no longer generate, if not asked for explicitly,
   and (ii) garbage collection is no longer done after each column.

 
Version: 0.9.3 [2008-06-08]

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.7.0 patched.
 
 
Version: 0.9.2.6 [2008-06-07]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Update filename pattern for getOutputFiles() of AromaTransform.
 
 
Version: 0.9.2.5 [2008-05-25]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added AromaTransform (extracted from aroma.affymetrix::Transform).

 * Added nbrOfArrays() to AromaMicroarrayDataSet.

 * Now private xmlToList() handles more complex XML strings.
 
 
Version: 0.9.2.4 [2008-05-22]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added member 'chromosome' to RawCopyNumbers.

 * Added gaussianSmoothing() to RawCopyNumbers.

 * Added argument 'xOut' to gaussianSmoothing() in order to specify at what
   loci the smoothed signals should be calculated.
 
 
Version: 0.9.2.3 [2008-05-21]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added gzip()/gunzip() to GenericDataFile.

 * Added static findByName() and byName() to GenericDataFileSet.

 * Added static getFileClass() to GenericDataFileSet.  This makes it possible
   to remove most fromFiles() from subclasses but also the validation of
   argument 'files' of their constructors.

 * Added validate() to GenericDataFileSet, which is called at the end of
   fromFiles(..., .validate=TRUE).

 * Added extractMatrix to GenericTabular(File|Set) and
   AromaTabularBinary(File|Set).

 * Added equals() and hasFile() to GenericDataFileSet.

 * Added classes GenericTabularFileSet and AromaTabularBinarySet.

 * Added stextChipType() for strings.

 * ALPHA: Now equals() for GenericDataFile:s uses the class, pathname, file
   size and file-contents checksum to do the comparison.  Similarly, for
   GenericDataFileSet:s, the class, path, number of files, pathnames, and
   finally equals() for each file pair is used for the comparison.

 * ALPHA: Added full name translation for GenericDataFile:s.

 * ALPHA: Added UnitNamesFile.

SOFTWARE QUALITY:

 * Package passes R CMD check on R v2.7.0 patched.
 
 * Now findPngDevice() search for a working PNG device in the following order:
   png(..., type="cairo"), png(..., type="cairo1"), Cairo::CairoPNG(),
   R.utils::png2(), and finally plain png().

REFACTORIZATION:

 * CLEAN UP: Moved more classes and methods from aroma.affymetrix to
   aroma.core: RawCopyNumbers, CopyNumberRegions, CopyNumberOutliers.
   Moved attribute methods from AffymetrixCel{File|Set} to
   AromaMicroarrayDataSet.  Moved stextNnn() methods from AffymetrixFile
   to AffymetrixMicroarrayDataSet.  Created superclass
   AromaMicroarrayDataSetTuple of AffymetrixCelSetTuple.

BUG FIXES:

 * BUG FIX: readDataFrame() did not read the first data row if there was no
   column header; it was eaten up by a preceeding readHeader().

 * BUG FIX: findAnnotationDataByChipType(chipType="GenomeWideSNP_6",
   pattern="^GenomeWideSNP_6.*[.]ugp$") would find file
   'GenomeWideSNP_6,Full,na24.ugp' before 'GenomeWideSNP_6,na24.ugp'.
   Now we return the one with the shortest full name.
 
 
Version: 0.9.2 [2008-05-10]

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES:

 * Package created.

 * Took all core classes and core methods in aroma.affymetrix that are
   independent of the Affymetrix platform and placed the here.

 * The version is numbered starting from the current version of
   aroma.affymetrix.

BUG FIXES:

 * interleave() for Image gave 'Error in z[idxOdd, ] : incorrect number of
   dimensions'.  The internal image structure is a 3-dim array.

 * When searching with 'firstOnly=FALSE', findAnnotationData() was identifying
   files that are in "private" directory.  This is how affxparser::findFiles()
   works.  Such files are now filtered out.
