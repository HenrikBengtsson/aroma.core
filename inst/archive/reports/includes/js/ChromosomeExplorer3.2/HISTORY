ChromosomeExplorer
==================

2012-02-01
o GENERALIZATION: By moving 'var explorer = new ChromosomeExplorer();'
  from includes/js/ChromosomeExplorer3.x/main.js to the dataset
  specific ChromosomeExplorer.onLoad.js, ChromosomeExplorer now works
  on Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari. 
  This far it is known to work work with Chrome v17.0, 
  Firefox v3.6/v9.01/v10.0, IE v7/v9., and Safari 5.
  Thanks to Keith Ching at ConsultChing for providing the troubleshooting
  and the solution, cf. http://consultching.com/root/?p=64.

o BUG FIX: Drag of navigator and panel did not work on Firefox on *nix.
  Forgot to retrieve mouse position in onmousemove(). For some reason
  it worked on Windows.
o Added support for multiple chip types too.  This requires that the
  sample image files have equal names for the different chip types.
o Now the current chip type, sample, chromsome and zoom is highlighted.
