o Started to add support for image layers.

2007-01-07
o Added link to regions.xls file in the browser.

2006-11-06
o BUG FIX: Drag of navigator and panel did not work on Firefox on *nix.
  Forgot to retrieve mouse position in onmousemove(). For some reason
  it worked on Windows.
o Added support for multiple chip types too.  This requires that the
  sample image files have equal names for the different chip types.
o Now the current chip type, sample, chromsome and zoom is highlighted.
