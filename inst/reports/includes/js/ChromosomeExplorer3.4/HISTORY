ChromosomeExplorer
==================

2012-02-04
o Created ChromosomeExplorer v3.4.  Cleanup ChromosomeExplorer code by
  removing several global variables.  Also have a better understanding
  on how Javascripts are loaded when using the requireJS module.

o GENERALIZATION: Created ChromosomeExplorer v3.3.  It utilizes the
  require.js package, which asserts that *all* Javascripts are loaded
  (in order) before starting the ChromosomeExplorer itself.  It turns
  out that the main reason why ChromosomeExplorer did not work in
  other browsers than Firefox v3.6 was simply that other browsers
  do not necessarily load the scripts in the same order and equally
  fast so that we tried to start the main function before everything
  was defined and loaded.
  This far it is known to work work with Chrome v17.0, 
  Firefox v3.6/v9.01/v10.0, IE v7/v9., and Safari 5.
  This solution is thanks to a blog post by Keith Ching at ConsultChing
  showing that it works in other browsers with some minor changes leading
  me on the right track, cf. http://consultching.com/root/?p=64

o Minor tuning. Tested on Firefox 3.01. Don't know about Firefox 2.


2008-06-23
o Updated to work with Firefox 3.


2007-01-07
o Added link to regions.xls file in the browser.

o BUG FIX: Drag of navigator and panel did not work on Firefox on *nix.
  Forgot to retrieve mouse position in onmousemove(). For some reason
  it worked on Windows.
o Added support for multiple chip types too.  This requires that the
  sample image files have equal names for the different chip types.
o Now the current chip type, sample, chromsome and zoom is highlighted.
